# AI Prompt Templates for THIWebsite

This folder contains example AI prompts and templates to help non-technical maintainers generate and update website content with minimal effort. Store prompts you find useful here so future staff can copy-and-paste them into an AI assistant.

Files:
- `templates.md` â€” practical prompt templates for common tasks (bios, alt text, rewrites, accessibility checks, commit messages).

How to use:
1. Open the template you want to use (`prompts/templates.md`).
2. Copy the prompt text and paste it into your AI assistant (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.).
3. Replace the placeholders (e.g., [BIO TEXT], [FILENAME]) with your content.
4. Review the output carefully and paste it into the corresponding file in `nonprofit-website/src/`.

Please keep prompts simple and specific. If a prompt yields a great result, add it to this folder so others can reuse it.
