## Usage

2. Use tabs to switch between different management sections
3. All changes are immediately saved to Azure Function APIs
4. Changes appear instantly on the public website

## Technical Details

### APIs Used
- **Board Members**: `https://harambee-board-api.azurewebsites.net/api/board-members`
- **Naming Opportunities**: `https://harambee-board-api.azurewebsites.net/api/naming-opportunities`

### Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Each admin section is a separate JavaScript class
- **ES6 Classes**: Modern JavaScript with proper encapsulation
- **Event-Driven**: Uses DOM events for form handling
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management with user feedback
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly interface

### Adding New Admin Sections

1. Create a new JavaScript module (e.g., `events.js`)
2. Add a new tab in `index.html`
3. Add the corresponding tab content HTML
4. Include the script in the main file
5. Follow the existing pattern for consistent UX

## Maintenance

- Each module is self-contained and can be updated independently
- Shared utilities are in the main `index.html` file
- CSS styles are centralized in the main file
- API endpoints can be easily changed in each module's constructor

## Security Notes

- Currently uses anonymous access to Azure Functions
- For production, consider adding authentication
- All user inputs are sanitized via `escapeHtml()` function
- CORS is properly configured on the backend APIs
